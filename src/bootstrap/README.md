# chatbot-engine-bootstrap

This repository implements a typical chatbot server using express.js. In order to use this, you need to:

- Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- Make sure peer dependencies are available in the host project.
- `index.ts` exports a default function that packages a chatbot server, so you need to import and call it with specified parameters.
